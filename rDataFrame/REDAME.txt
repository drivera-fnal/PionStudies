The scripts in this folder with .C run with the ROOT::RDataFrame

The header file lambda.h contains some lambda function definitions to filter
the Tree for events etc. plotting is done in thre .C macros.

in the folder inputFile sits an inputFile.root that contains the Tree produced
by Jakes pionAnalyzerMC_module.cxx with LArSoft. all the macros run by default
on this. do run one of the macros do:

root -l .x macroName.C

if you'd like to change the input file run the macro as:
root -l .x "macroName.C('path/to/file.root')"
